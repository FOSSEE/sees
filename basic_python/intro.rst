Introduction
============

  The Python programming language was created by a dutch named Guido van Rossum.
  The idea of Python was conceived in December 1989. The name Python has nothing
  to do with the reptilian, but its been named after the 70s comedy series 
  "Monty Python's Flying Circus", since it happens to be Guido's favourite 
  TV series. 
  
  Current stable version of Python is 2.6.x, although Python 3.0 is also the stable
  version, it is not backwards compatible with the previous versions and is hence
  not entirely popular at the moment. This material contains material pertaining 
  to the 2.6.x series.
