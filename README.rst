About
=====

Engineering & science students use computers for a large number of
curricular tasks -- mostly computation centred. However, they do not
see this as coding or programming tasks and usually are not even aware
of the tools and techniques that will help them to handle these tasks
better. This results in less than optimal use of their time and
resources. This also causes difficulties when it comes to
collaboration and building on other people's work. 

This program is intended to train such students in good software
practices and tools for producing code and documentation. SEES stands
for *Software Engineering for Engineers and Scientists.*
