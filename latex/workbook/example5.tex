Python is a general-purpose high-level programming language whose
design philosophy emphasizes code readability. Python aims to combine
"remarkable power with very clear syntax", and its standard library is
large and comprehensive. Its use of indentation for block delimiters
is unusual among popular programming languages.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, primarily but not
limited to object oriented, imperative and, to a lesser extent,
functional programming styles. It features a fully dynamic type system
and automatic memory management, similar to that of Scheme, Ruby,
Perl, and Tcl. Like other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a
scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting
contexts. 

The reference implementation of Python (CPython) is free and open
source software and has a community-based development model, as do all
or nearly all of its alternative implementations. CPython is managed
by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.
