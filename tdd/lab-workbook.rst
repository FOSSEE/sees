Lab - 1
=======

  1. Write a stub function for calculating the LCM of two numbers.
  2. Write the tests for the LCM function, place the tests in if
     __name__ == '__main__': part of the Python file. Demonstrate that
     the tests fail.
  3. Implement the code for the LCM function, using the gcd function
     provided in the examples in the chapter. Demonstrate the tests
     pass. (For the algorithm refer to Wikipedia - [0])
  4. Alternatively, build a set of test cases, preferably a large
     number of cases, place it in a text file and use these test cases
     to test your LCM function. Demonstrate that tests still continue
     to pass.
