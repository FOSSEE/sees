1. Check out the repository from http://fossee.in:9000

#. Set your username and email id in you global user preferences. 

#. Add a copy of the folder, ``punchagan`` with your own name. The
   ``01-mercurial`` folder needs to have only ``questions.txt``. You need not
   copy the ``people.txt`` and ``story.txt`` file. Commit your changes with a
   meaningful commit message and push them.

#. Pull from the repo. Update. Use ``hg log`` to see the log history of the
   repository.

#. Answer the questions in ``questions.txt``. Commit your changes with a
   meaningful commit message and push them.

#. Wait for your neighbor to finish making his/her changes. Help him/her if
   required. Once both of you are ready, pull changes from the repository and
   update. 

   Now, add one question each, at the bottom of your own ``questions.txt``
   file and your neighbor's file. Preferably, the questions should be about
   ``hg`` , but you may, let your creativity run wild. ;) Commit the changes
   and push them. Resolve merge conflicts, as required.

#. Answer the new questions that were added by your neighbor, both to his/her
   file and your file. Commit changes. Push.

#. Edit the file ``people.txt`` in ``punchagan/01-mercurial`` . Add your
   name, followed by a colon, followed by a comma separated list of your
   interests. Commit your changes and push.

#. Edit the file ``story.txt`` in the folder ``punchagan/01-mercurial`` and
   add one sentence at the end of the present story. Commit your changes and
   push them. Wait until at least 3 other people change the file, before you
   make your next change. This can continue for as long as you like. ;)
