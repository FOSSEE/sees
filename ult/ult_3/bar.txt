"Bar" as the second term in the series may have developed in
electronics, where a digital signal which is considered "on" with a
negative or zero-voltage condition is identified with a horizontal bar
over the signal label; the notation for an inverted signal foo would
then be pronounced "foo bar". Bar may also be read as beyond all
repair, which is how it is used in the acronym FUBAR.
