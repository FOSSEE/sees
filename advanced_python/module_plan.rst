Module Objectives
-----------------

After successfully completing this module a participant will be able to:

* generate 2D plots                                              {Ap}
* Work with arrays and use them effectively                      {Ap}
* Solve linear, polynomial and other non-linear equations        {Ap}
* Solve ODEs                                                     {Ap}
* Write mid-sized programs that carry out typical                {Ap}
  engineering/numerical computations such as those that involve
  (basic) manipulation of large arrays in an efficient manner
